User inputs 24 hour former into a string called str\
Change str into an array of ints by c_str\
Using a for loop, check the indexes the where numbers are and make sure they\'92re between 0 and 9\
if they in the limits, increment size to check how many numbers there are\
assign the int, hours, and seconds into their values by changing the string into an array of characters by Atio.\
From there use the c_str to change it back to an int array and use substring to assign the hours, minutes, and seconds.\
